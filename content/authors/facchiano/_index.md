Hello! I'm Simone Facchiano, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and soon to embark on my PhD journey. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Management Statistics, where I graduated with honors (110 cum laude) in 2022. During my Master's studies, I further broadened my horizons with an enriching Erasmus semester at Maastricht University ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, and an experience as tutor of Statistical Inference. I'm also part of my academic Honours Program, focusing my research on Diffusion Models combined with Mamba for Video Anomaly Detection.

Currently, I'm working on my thesis in collaboration with CINECA, where we're exploring the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs). My passion for Deep Learning and AI spans across various domains, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Audio Synthesis.

In my free time I am a literature enthusiast, and I have been playing guitar for over a decade.
