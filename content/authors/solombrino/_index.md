{style="text-align: justify;"}
I am a PhD student at GLADIA Research Group, under the supervision of Prof. Emanuele Rodol√† (Sapienza University of Rome).

My research focuses on Model Merging, and I plan to expand into music editing and Geometric Deep Learning. 

During my BSc in Computer Science, I developed a passion for High Performance Computing and GPU programming, which led me to pursue a Deep Learning-focused MSc, where I worked on music classification, transfer learning and heterogeneous knowledge distillation in medical imaging, and disentangled representation learning for text.

I am also a fan of minimalism, growth, planning, and EDM music, particularly Hardstyle and all of its subgenres.
